# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 

<!--

Airbnb.com
Vrbo.com
Bluepillow.com

-->

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

<!-- 

While exploring each and one of the websites that was provided, it was shown that they provide a variety of options to users who are looking for a place to stay preferably for vacation. The user can choose an approximate date range of how long they will be staying in the area to which they are traveling to. While browsing throughout the webpages, these specific houses, hotels, apartments etc.;  provide a brief description, prices, contact information, direct location, along with star ratings and reviews from individuals who previously spent several nights at the specific location. We struggle when attempting to finding the right place to stay for a special occasion, but having websites like these can eliminate the stress of individuals in spending hours searching for a good night stay.

*List at least 10 product features*

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

<!--

-	The user research suggests that both qualitative and quantitative research provides a user’s thoughts. As the user explores the website and answers the research questions provided to them, the same results come up when the individual searching knows the type of vacation, they’re looking for but unsure on the specific destination to stay. Some pain points users are describing as they interact with the Marriott website attempting to find the right place. Based upon the opinions of the users, the website seemed to be too overwhelming. The Marriott website did not provide the best results, especially when looking throughout the map, there was no specific place to show what’s popular within the area. The experience I think the users wish for is being able to have a website that could possibly have a variety of options from a search bar, or checkbox that narrows down the search of what exactly they want their vacation to be.
